Using [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)? Want to reduce stock for only the initial purchase of subscription products?

Install and activate this plugin.

By default, WooCommerce reduces stock for any order containing a product. This means stock will be reduced for both the initial purchase of a subscription product and all [renewal orders](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/renewal-process/). This extension stops stock being reduced for renewal orders.

> Note: this plugin was originally made available [via a Gist](https://gist.github.com/thenbrent/968526e7ae01308eaabc/). It's been moved into this repository because of the discussion and popularity of that gist.
